\description{
Computations of Fisher's z-tests concerning differences between correlations.

diffcor.one() could be used to test for differences regarding an expected value,
e.g., in construct validation.

diffcor.two() may be useful in replication studies, to test if the original study
and the replication study differed in terms of effects.

diffcor.dep() can be applied to check if the correlation between one construct
with another one (r12) is significantly different/higher/smaller than the
correlation of one of the constructs with a third construct (r13), given the
correlation of the constructs that are compared (r23).

The outputs for all the three functions provide the compared correlations, test
statistic in z-units, and p-values. For diffcor.one() and diffcor.two(), the
output further provides confidence intervals of the empirical correlations and
the effect size Cohens q. According to Cohen (1988), q = |.10|, |.30| and |.50|
are considered small, moderate, and large differences, respectively.}
