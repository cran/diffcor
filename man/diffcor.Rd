\usage{
diffcor.one(emp.r, hypo.r, n, cor.names = NULL,
alternative = c("one.sided", "two.sided"), digit = 3)

diffcor.two(r1, r2, n1, n2, cor.names = NULL,
alternative = c("one.sided", "two.sided"), digit = 3)

diffcor.dep(r12, r13, r23, n, cor.names = NULL,
alternative = c("one.sided", "two.sided"), digit = 3)
}

\arguments{
\item{emp.r}{empirically observed correlation}
\item{hypo.r}{hypothesized correlation which shall be tested}
\item{n}{sample size in which the observed effect was found}
\item{cor.names}{Label for the respective correlation (e.g., "IQ-performance").
This is especially advantageous if you test a series of correlations
simultaneously, see examples. Per default, cor.names is NULL}
\item{digit}{number of decimal places for p-values}
\item{alternative}{a character string to specify if you wish to test one-sided
or two-sided differences}
\item{r1}{first correlation coefficient}
\item{r2}{second correlation coefficient}
\item{n1}{sample size the first correlation coeffient is based on}
\item{n2}{sample size the second correlation coeffient is based on}
\item{r12}{correlation between first and second construct}
\item{r13}{correlation between first and third construct}
\item{r23}{correlation between second and third construct}
}
\description{
Computations of Fisher's z-tests concerning differences between correlations.

diffcor.one() could be used to test for differences regarding an expected value,
e.g., in construct validation.

diffcor.two() may be useful in replication studies, to test if the original study
and the replication study differed in terms of effects.

diffcor.dep() can be applied to check if the correlation between one construct
with another one (r12) is significantly different/higher/smaller than the
correlation of one of the constructs with a third construct (r13), given the
correlation of the constructs that are compared (r23).

The outputs for all the three functions provide the test statistic in z-units,
95 percent confidence intervals, and p-values. For diffcor.one() and
diffcor.two(), the output further provides the effect size Cohens q as well as
confidence intervals for the empirical correlations. According to Cohen (1988),
q = |.10|, |.30| and |.50| are considered small, moderate, and large differences,
respectively.}

\value{
\item{z}{test statistic for correlation difference in units of the standard normal distribution}
\item{LL}{Lower limit of the 95 percent confidence interval of the empirical correlation}
\item{UL}{Upper limit of the 95 percent confidence interval of the empirical correlation}
\item{LL1}{Lower limit of the 95 percent confidence interval of the first empirical correlation}
\item{UL1}{Upper limit of the 95 percent confidence interval of the first empirical correlation}
\item{LL2}{Lower limit of the 95 percent confidence interval of the second empirical correlation}
\item{UL2}{Upper limit of the 95 percent confidence interval of the second empirical correlation}
\item{p}{p value for one- or two-sided testing, depending on alternative = c("one.sided", "two.sided)}
\item{Cohen_q}{effect size measure for differences of independent correlations}
