or two-sided differences}

\description{
Computations of Fisher's z-tests concerning differences between correlations.

diffcor.one() can be used to test if an observed correlation differs from an
expected one, for example, in construct validation. diffcor.two() can be used
to test if the correlation between two variables differs across two independent
studies. diffcor.dep() can be applied to check if the correlation between two
variables (r12) differs from the correlation between the first and a third one
(r13), given the intercorrelation of the compared constructs (r23). All outputs
provide the compared correlations, test statistic as z-score, and p-values. For
diffcor.one() and diffcor.two(), the output further provides confidence intervals
of the empirical correlations and the effect size Cohens q. According to Cohen
(1988), q = |.10|, |.30| and |.50| are considered small, moderate, and large
differences, respectively.}
