Description: Computations of Fisher's z-tests concerning differences between correlations. diffcor.one() could be used to test for differences regarding an expected value, e.g., in construct validation. diffcor.two() may be useful in replication studies, to test if the original study and the replication study differed in terms of effects. diffcor.dep() can be applied to check if the correlation between one construct with another one (r12) is significantly different/higher/smaller than the correlation of one of the constructs with a third construct (r13), given the correlation of the constructs that are compared (r23). The outputs for all the three functions provide the compared correlations, test statistic in z-units, and p-values. For diffcor.one() and diffcor.two(), the output further provides confidence intervals of the empirical correlations and the effect size Cohens q. According to Cohen (1988), q = |.10|, |.30| and |.50| are considered small, moderate, and large differences, respectively.
